With these online breakfast instructions you can navigate our kitchen.
This website helps you find different kitchen equipment to help
you make both vegan and non vegan breakfast recipes.
If you use this guide then you'll be able to easily navigate the
kitchen and make some delicious breakfasts!
This website is better than a paper version because you can check
the guide from anywhere.

You may only use breakfast-instructions for internal projects.
